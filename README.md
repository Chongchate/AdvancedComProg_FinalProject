# AdvancedComProg_FinalProject
This project is a part of Advanced Computer Programming(2190102). The idea of this application is to display the characteristics of each pokemon,
show the interesting facts among them (ex. max atk,max def) and a simple arena that can select two pokemons to find the winner.
